_______________________

Tic tac toe is a game you can learn in seconds and master in minutes, this is my take on the old time classic game of Xs and Os.

### Planning
_________________________________________

As my first project at GA I need to create a SAP of tic tac toe in a week.

I used the following technologies to build my project:

* jQuery
* JavaScript
* Html
* CSS/SASS
* Bootstrap
* Ajax

As with any project day one was all about planning and setting everything up, after reviewing the requirements I came up with the following user stories for the app:

1. As a user, I want a grid to play the game.
2. As a user, I want to see who’s turn is it on screen.
3. As a user, I want to see when someone wins the game on the screen or if is a draw
4. As a user, I want to be able to create an account.
5. As a user, I want log in with an email and password.
6. As a user, I want to be able to change my password
7. As a user, I want to be able to sign out.
8. As a user, I want to be able to start a new game at any time.
9. As a user, I want to be able to get the amount of games played by me.

### Development Process
_____

As expected building a browser-based game from scratch as first project after 3 weeks was not going to be easy, writing the game logic at first was not as bad as I thought it’d be, nice! day 2 and I have my board working and I’m placing Xs and Os all over the place, I said to myself that was the hard part now you have 4 more days to set up the API calls and all that easy!, well it wasn’t that easy.

The PATCH method it’s something I’ll never forget about this project, it was really challenging it helped to really understand how to use and storage the objects I was getting from the API.

In all my development process I focused on small parts of the app instead of working in all at once that help me save time and meet my daily goals to keep on track.

### Future updates/interactions
____

-Fix bug where you need to click “See games history” twice to see the user game history on screen.
-Fix sign in bug- changing view when logging in with wrong password, resulting in the user getting “stuck” in the signed in view.
-Add player vs computer functionality
-Add full responsive design for different screen sizes.
